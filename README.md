## Hello 👋

My name is Charlotte, and I study brain–body interactions during movement using mobile EEG, EMG, biomechanics, and computational modeling. I build analysis pipelines and statistical tools to better understand how neural and motor systems change with aging and neurological injury and how novel interventions affect those relationships.

🧠My Research interests:
- Biomechanics
- Neuromodulation
- Brain–muscle communication
- Aging and neurological injury
- Machine learning
